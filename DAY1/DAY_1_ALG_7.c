7>ALGORITHM
PALINDROME OR NOT
1.we are taking the variable as temp,number,rem and rev.
2.first we have to store that number into temp variable.
3.if the remainder is greater than zero only it will it enter into the condition.
4.Like,rev=rev*10+rem and number is stored in rev.
5.check if temp is equality of rev only it will print as palindrome.
6.otherwise it will print as not palindrome .
